# Namaste React ðŸš€

# Parcel - A BEAST
- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement (Automatically Refreshing our page / Build AGAIN if any new changes saved in file)
- File Watching Algorithm (written in C++: Keeping Track of every save in project)
- Caching - Faster Builds (.parcel-cache) Due to this It always takes lesser time if we keep refreshing
- Image Optimisation (as image loading is the mostly thing on webpage)
- Minification of files on production
- Bundling
- Compress
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundling - support of older browsers (Provide different type of bundle for different browsers and older versions - will add required things)
- Diagnostics
- Error Handlings (Good error & suugestions)
- HTTPs (You can test on https)
- Tree Shaking Algorithm - (Remove unused code for you ðŸ˜± - if only 3 functions in use out of 5 -> it'll remove 2 unused fn.)
- Lazy Dev Builds
- Different Dev & Production Builds (Production takes more time - since it has more optimisation)

### That's why we need a lot more things in order to make our web app faster & it's not just React.
